## Overview

TEC, a company that required a digital platform to efficiently manage their subcontractors, track equipment usage, and streamline project workflows. 

eZZYSoft Solutions developed a custom-built web application using Blazor, providing TCC with a robust and scalable platform that integrated project management and resource allocation capabilities. The solution allowed real-time tracking of equipment, contractor assignment, and progress updates across multiple job sites. 

With a focus on user experience, the platform delivered by eZZYSoft ensured that the TCC team could monitor, adjust, and optimize project execution, improving transparency and operational efficiency. The solution has become essential to TCC’s daily operations, offering an intuitive interface for the team to collaborate and manage all project phases effectively.

  Studio did an amazing job building out our core blockchain infrastructure and
  I’m sure once PlaceboCoin rallies they’ll be able to finish the project.
