## Overview

Charta Packaging, a Wellington-based company specializing in manufacturing boxes and packaging products for vineyards across New Zealand, needed a robust solution to manage their customer and order processes. To meet this need, your team developed a comprehensive, end-to-end system using Microsoft CRM. The goal was to streamline and enhance their operations, from customer relationship management to order processing.

The solution's Customer Relationship Management (CRM) component allowed Charta Packaging to effectively manage customer interactions, store valuable customer data, and nurture long-term relationships. It provided the tools necessary to track customer engagement, maintain an organized database, and improve communication with their clients.

In addition to CRM, the order management aspect of the system simplified the process of capturing, tracking, and fulfilling customer orders. The solution ensured that every order was processed efficiently, with clear visibility into the entire order lifecycle, from placement to delivery. This integration across the CRM and order management system helped Charta Packaging enhance both customer satisfaction and internal efficiency.
